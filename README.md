# The GAP package Salvetti-and-tori-complexes

    This package provides several functions to build the Salvetti complex of a finite irreducible Coxeter group and the W-equivariant cellular homology chain complex of any maximal torus of a simple compact Lie group, described by its root datum.
    It also allows to recover the homology of the torus as a rational representation of the Weyl group W, given as a map into a matrix group.
    Moreover, this combinatorics is extended to the hyperbolic manifold of a finite irreducible Coxeter groups, using a particular reflection as the element playing the role of the reflection associated to the highest root appearing in the Weyl case.
    As we also provide functions to translate the differentials of the complexes as matrices with integer coefficients, one can also study these complexes through an adapted package, such as "Homalg" or "CAP" for instance.
    The Salvetti complex is constructed as in [DeConcini-Salvetti] and the one for tori and hyperbolic manifolds is as described in [Garnier2021].

## Installation

To install this package, just download the entire folder containing this 
README file and unpack it in the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation. 
This creates a subdirectory called 'Salvetti-and-tori-complexes' and completes the 
installation of the package. You can now load it in a GAP terminal.
